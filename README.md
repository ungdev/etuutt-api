<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Swagger screenshot](docs/images/interface.png)](https://api-dev.etuutt-2020.uttnetgroup.fr/)

Here's a screenshot of the Swagger UI. It is the user friendly way to deal with the API, so that front teams want to offer us beers ! üçª\
It is also useful to test and debug new features.\
You can go to that page by clicking on the image.

### Built With

* [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is the API documentation. Everything that is concerned the front and the back is in [the project documentation](https://ungdev.github.io/etuutt-core/).\
First, you will have to read the project doc, then what follows.

### Prerequisites

At this point, thanks to [this part of the documentation](https://ungdev.github.io/etuutt-core/1-Configuration/), you have all prerequisites to install the API on your computer.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo by opening a command prompt in the folder you want it to be
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ungdev/etuutt-api
   ```
2. Install composer packages
   ```sh
   composer install
   ```
3. Duplicate the `.env` file and name it `.env.local`\
   You will put your private info in this file, such as passwords or path to your local database. This `.env.local` will not be sent to GitHub, it is local to your computer.

### Run the project

Now that everything is installed and ready to go, let the magic begin ‚ú®
```sh
symfony serve
```
Once the local server is running, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Make a request

The Swagger UI allows us to see endpoint documentation as well as sending request to test them, awesome üòç\
Here is how to make a `GET` request via Swagger, but they all work the same.

![Send a GET request](docs/images/send_request.gif)

In this example, we ask kindly to our API the list of all groups üòá\
As you can see, there is a pagination system, that is why above the `Execute` button, we can see an input to specify the page number.\
Dealing with other endpoints, you will have to fill a `request body` or more input parameters, to search for a specific entity for instance.\
\
The magical part comes when we hit this `Execute` button. Swagger sends the HTTP request to our API using `curl`, a command line tool to send request. To help us, it shows the command line it processed. There it is :
```sh
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/groups?page=1' \
  -H 'accept: application/ld+json' \
  -H 'CAS-LOGIN: admin'
```

Then, we wait for a short time, and the `response body` is prompted.\
The data we recieved comes with its metadata, this is the `ld+json` format.


### Log a user

In some cases, some requests have to be sent by a specific user. To authenticate a user, type its CAS login in the `Authorize` section as shown in the following gif.

But first, some points to keep in mind üìù
- There is a user which CAS login is `admin` that has all the privileges.
- Once the CAS login is filled in the authorize section, swagger will include a header containing this information in requests to the API.
- In production, this API is encapsulated in [the gateway](https://github.com/ungdev/etuutt-gateway), so that users have to give their credentials to authenticate. More about gateway authentication in [its documentation](https://github.com/ungdev/etuutt-gateway). Requests are sent to the gateway which forwards them to the API.

### Useful commands

Here is a list of commands to manipulate the database, entities and `php-cs-fixer`.

- To create the empty database.
   ```sh
   php bin/console doctrine:database:create
   ```
- To delete the database.
   ```sh
   php bin/console doctrine:database:drop --force
   ```
- To update the table structure to match all entities without migrations.
   ```sh
   php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
   ```
- To delete all tables in the database that are refereced by an entity.
   ```sh
   php bin/console doctrine:schema:drop --force
   ```
- To delete all tables in the database.
   ```sh
   php bin/console doctrine:schema:drop --full-database --force
   ```
- To start the database seeding based on `DataFixtures`.
   ```sh
   php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load -n
   ```
- To regenerate the getters and setters of the targeted entity.
   ```sh
   php bin/console make:entity --regenerate
   ```
- To call `php-cs-fixer` to modify the PHP code on src folder so that it follows the conventions of `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` file.
   ```sh
   php vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src
   vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer.bat fix src
   ```
